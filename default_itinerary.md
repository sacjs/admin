# Default Meetup Itinerary

###### 6:00 - Meetup Preparation

* Setup event space (chairs, swag, food, etc.)

* Welcome speakers

  Ensure speakers have arrived, are parked, settled, laptops are charged and
  work with the projector.

  Ensure speakers are aware of the Code of Conduct and agree not to violate it.

* Prepare first speaker (laptop charged, slides ready to run, etc.)

###### 6:30 - Meetup Starts

###### 8:30 - Meetup Ends

* Module of the Month

  unique. Some great sources of ideas include DailyJS.

  Not only does this expose attendees to cool modules, but it can also highlight
  the existence of NPM/Bower and the power of open source to our beginner
  attendees.

* Community cross-promotion (Angular, Famous, GDG, etc.)

* Swag giveaways

* Clean-up event space
